# Eden

This was my biggest and longest-running project. 

It was originally intended to be an evolution-centered game where players would evolve their autonomous species in response to their environments and rival species. However, I got distracted by making the environment perfect and spent a year and a half without writing the animals. Eventually I moved on to other projects, but it's still a pretty boss 2D environment simulator. 

The game is built on a 2D grid and relies very heavily on polymorphism.
