# Eden

This was a very ambitious project and I spent about a year and a half working on it during college. It was intended to be a cross between Dwarf Fortress and Plague Inc where the player would alter the genetic traits of a computer-controlled species. However, I couldn't figure out how to make it short enough to be playable and never got to actual gameplay. 

This project was originally written in Java but I rewrote it in C++ for speed.
