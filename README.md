# Eden

This was a very ambitious project and I spent a year and a half on it before abandoning it. It was originally intended to be a cross between Dwarf Fortress and Plague Inc where the player would control the genetic traits of a computer-controlled species. However, I got caught up giving the environment a dwarf-fortress level of detail and never got to the actual game part. 

This project was originally written in Java but I rewrote it in C++ for better speed.
